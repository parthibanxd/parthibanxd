    "Clean & Neat Version (Rewritten)\n",
    "🔹 1. What Do We Want?\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to detect PM2.5 pollution spikes in real time.\n",
    "If PM2.5 crosses a dangerous limit (example: 120 µg/m³), the system should immediately show:\n",
    "\n",
    "“PM2.5 SPIKE at Sensor S1!”\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps notify officials and citizens before the air becomes harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. Sliding Window (Simple Explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "A sliding window continuously examines only recent readings, not old ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Current time: 10:05\n",
    "\n",
    "Window checks data from 10:00 to 10:05\n",
    "\n",
    "After 30 seconds:\n",
    "\n",
    "Window shifts to 10:00:30 to 10:05:30\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows fast detection of new spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why sliding window?\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time systems must focus on latest data\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevents old values from affecting alerts\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps detect sudden pollution increases\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 3. Steps to Detect a PM2.5 Spike\n",
    "Step 1: Continuously read sensor data\n",
    "\n",
    "(Like water flowing through a pipe)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Store last 5 minutes of readings\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is the sliding window)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Check threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "If any value > 120 µg/m³, this is a spike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Trigger alert & update dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Alerts appear immediately so authorities can act.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 4. Visualization (Simple and Effective)\n",
    "City Map (Color-coded)\n",
    "\n",
    "🟢 Green → Normal\n",

    "Live Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A time-series chart showing PM2.5 rising & falling over time.\n",

    "⭐ Conclusion (PM2.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time monitoring checks air quality continuously.\n",
    "Using a 5-minute sliding window, it detects PM2.5 spikes above 120 µg/m³.\n",
    "Alerts and visual dashboards help protect public health and support SDG-13.\n",
    "\n",
    "⭐ WATER QUALITY (DO Monitoring) – Clean & Neat Version\n",
    "🔹 1. Data Ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors send DO (Dissolved Oxygen) readings every few seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "A streaming system (Kafka / Spark / Flink) collects data\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 2. Sliding Window (60 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1-minute window is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Window 1 → 00:00 to 00:01  \n",
    "Window 2 → 00:00:05 to 00:01:05  \n",
    "Window 3 → 00:00:10 to 00:01:10  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach always checks fresh water quality data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Inside each window:\n",
    "\n",
    "If DO < 5 mg/L → Poor water quality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "If the window shows repeated DO < 5 mg/L:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instant alert is generated\n",
    "\n",
    "Event is saved to database\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental authorities are notified\n",

    "🔹 6. How It Supports SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "This system helps achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Prevents water contamination\n",
    "✔ Helps detect industrial pollution early\n",
    "✔ Protects aquatic life (fish, plants)\n",
    "✔ Enables safe drinking & agricultural water\n",
    "✔ Ensures 24/7 river monitoring\n",
    "⭐ Conclusion (DO Monitoring)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sliding window approach ensures that only recent water quality readings are analyzed.\n",
    "If DO repeatedly drops below 5 mg/L, the system triggers alerts and notifies authorities.\n",
    "This supports SDG-6 by ensuring safe, clean, and healthy water systems."
